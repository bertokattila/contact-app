This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.4.

## Development server

The easiest way to run the application is to run the `mvn spring-boot:run` command in the `server` folder.
There is no need to run the Angular application separately as the Spring hosts it as a compiled static resource.
